# React Native Todo App
First stab at a learning project for creating a React Native application using redux. Don't judge :grin:

## Setup
After following the [React Native getting started docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html), run: `react-native run-ios`

 * [ ] Style iOS app
 * [ ] Click to mark completed
